abstract = "In this note, we investigate some questions around velocity averaging lemmas, a class of results which ensure the regularity of the velocity average ${\\int f(x,v)\\psi(v) d \\mu( v)}$ when $v\\cdot \\nabla\\_xf$ both belong to $L^p$, $p \\in \\[1, \\infty)$ and the measured set of velocities $(\\mathscr{V}, d \\mu)$ satisfy a nondegenerancy assumption. We are interested in the case when the variable $v$ lies in a discrete subset of $\\mathbb{R}^D$. We present results obtained in collaboration with T. Goudon. First of all, we provide a rate, depending on the number of velocities, to the defect of $H^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ regularity which is reached when $v$ ranges over a continuous set. Second of all, we show that the $H^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ regularity holds in expectation when the set of velocities is chosen randomly. We apply this statement to obtain a consistency result for the diffusion limit in the case of the Rosseland approximation."
