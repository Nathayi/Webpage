abstract = "We go back to the question of the regularity of  the velocity average ${\\int f(x,v)\\psi(v) d \\mu( v)}$when $f$ and $v\\cdot \\nabla\\_xf$ both belong to $L^2$, and the variable $v$ lies in a discrete subset of $\\mathbb R^D$. <br> First of all, we provide a rate, depending on the number of velocities, to the defect of $H^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ regularity. Second of all, we show that the $H^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ regularity holds in expectation when the set of velocities is chosen randomly. We apply this statement to investigate the consistency with the diffusion asymptotics of a Monte--Carlo--like discrete velocity model. "
